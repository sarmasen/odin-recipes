Hello, this is my first try at building simple website using basics in HTML and CSS
It will be interesting journey with TOP. Excited to start! *Will update this later on as it evolves.

Forgot to open it in VScode.

did it commit?

ok, so i have mistakenly made a repository for this project under Downloads folder (D'oh), so i had to move it to the TOP projects folder and fix
repository link to git. Anyways, lets not do that again and start on this site creation.

testing terminal inside the VScode.

does git commit now work within VScode?
